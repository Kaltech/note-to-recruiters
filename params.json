{"name":"Note-to-recruiters","tagline":"","body":"# Note for Recruiters\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nRecruiting can be time consuming for small companies. There is no specialist team to deal with recruiting. It’s just us. We all have other work to be getting on with. We’re happy to work with recruiters if it makes our lives easier. However experience has shown that this is not always the case, and many recruiters add workload [cf: overhead reasons](overhead_reasons.md).\r\n\r\nPlease read our rules for working with us below. We don’t want to appear to be difficult to work with (we’re not) but we simply don’t have the time or capacity to manage agencies that don’t want to work with us in this way.\r\n\r\nAgencies/Recruiters not following these rules, will get blacklisted. Equally Agencies/Recruiters who stand out will be listed on the NTR under the ['Recommended Recruiters'](recommended_recruiters.md) section for other businesses to use.\r\n\r\n## Policy\r\n\r\n### Phone Calls\r\n* Do not call us. We do not take unsolicited calls for recruitment. Ever. Unsolicited calls are a fast way to make sure we won't work with you.\r\n* If we're working regarding a role or candiate, we'll explain how best to contact us about that role/candidate.\r\n* Do not call incessantly to find out if we’ve made a decision. We’ll give you a timeframe. If we say we’re going to get back to you on Monday, that’s when we’ll get back to you.\r\n\r\n### Positions\r\n* If you want to know about available jobs, keep an eye on our jobs page or twitter feed.\r\n* Each position will have its own specific email address. Send CVs to that email address for that position only.\r\n* Read the role. Do not send contractors if we specify permanent staff. Do not send PHP developers for a Rails position.\r\n\r\n### CVs /  Candidates\r\n* Do not send us anonymous CVs - they will not be considered. If you send us a candidate we want to know who they are, where they've worked and whether we've seen them before.\r\n* When sending us a CV, please include the candidate's salary expectations and availability\r\n* We typically only consider candidates already in the UK. If they are not in the UK, please tell us.\r\n\r\n### Terms and Conditions\r\n* We will not sign your terms and conditions. \r\n* The terms we work to are below:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Unacceptable practices. \r\n_Doing any of these will result in being automatically blacklisted and we won't work with you_\r\n\r\n* Do not lie to us. Do not phone and say you know us when you don’t. Do not tell the person answering the phone a different story to the person who you are trying to get hold of.\r\n* Do not try poach our staff. The whole team/office can hear when there is a recruiter on the line trying to do this. This makes both the person you’re speaking to uncomfortable, as well as the team around him. Do not do this.\r\n* Passing on details of candidates you’ve placed to other recruiters to try poach after you’ve received your fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Terms & Fees\r\n_These Terms supercede any similar terms in indivudal agency's contracts._\r\n\r\n* We will pay 15% of year 1 base salary\r\n* We will pay within 30 days of invoicing\r\n* The invoice date can be no earlier than the candidate's start date\r\n* If a candidate is employed by us within 6 months of an introduction by you, we will pay your fee.\r\n* If a candidate you introduce is already known to us (organically or from a different agency) we will tell you this promptly. No fee will be payable in this circumstance.\r\n* If the candidate leaves within 12 working weeks of their start date (for any reason, including dismissal), you will try to find a replacement free of charge.\r\n* If you are unable to find a replacement acceptable to us you will refund 8.3% of your fee for each week of the first 12 the candidate didn't work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
