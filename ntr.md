# Note to Recruiters

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in helping us with our hiring.  As you know, recruiting can be a time-consuming process for small companies. To make the process more efficient for everyone involved, we have a standard way of working with recruiters and managing our hiring process.

Please read our rules for working with us below. We don’t want to appear to be difficult to work with (we’re not) but we simply don’t have the time or capacity to manage agencies that don’t want to work with us in this way.

## Policy

### Phone Calls

* Please do not call us. We do not take unsolicited calls for recruitment.
* If we're working together regarding a role or candidate, we'll explain how best to contact us about that role/candidate.

### How to Start Working With Us

* Please don't email us suggesting a call to discuss our hiring.
* If you want to know about available jobs, please keep an eye on our [jobs page](https://broadmargins.recruiterbox.com/ "Jobs at Broadmargins").
* Each position will have an online application form. Please submit CVs via that form listing the candidate's name and your contact email address.
* Please read the description of the role carefully and only send appropriate candidates.

### CVs / Candidates

* Please do not send us anonymous CVs - they will unfortunately not be considered. If you send us a candidate, we want to know who they are, where they've worked and whether we've seen them before.
* When sending us a CV, please include the candidate's salary expectations and availability.
* We typically only consider candidates already in the UK. If they are not in the UK, please tell us.

### Terms and Conditions

The terms we work to are below:

* We will pay 15% of year 1 base salary
* We will pay within 30 days of invoicing
* The invoice date can be no earlier than the candidate's start date
* If a candidate is employed by us within 6 months of an introduction by you, we will pay your fee.
* If a candidate you introduce is already known to us (organically or from a different agency) we will tell you this promptly. No fee will be payable in this circumstance.
* If the candidate leaves within 12 working weeks of their start date (for any reason, including dismissal), you will try to find a replacement free of charge.
* If you are unable to find a replacement acceptable to us you will refund 8.3% of your fee for each week of the first 12 the candidate didn't work.
* If we hire a contractor through you and they subsequently go permanent with us, we will pay you 15% of their year 1 base salary less any fees we have paid you in relation to their contract work.

These Terms supersede any similar terms in individual agency's contracts.

We will not sign your terms and conditions.
