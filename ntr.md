# Note to Recruiters

## Introduction
Recruiting can be time consuming for small companies. There is no specialist team to deal with recruiting. It’s just us. We all have other work to be getting on with. We’re happy to work with recruiters if it makes our lives easier. However experience has shown that this is not always the case, and many recruiters add workload.

Please read our rules for working with us below. We don’t want to appear to be difficult to work with (we’re not) but we simply don’t have the time or capacity to manage agencies that don’t want to work with us in this way.

Agencies/Recruiters not following these rules, will get blacklisted. Equally Agencies/Recruiters who stand out will be given preference in future hiring.

## Policy

### Phone Calls

* Please do not call us. We do not take unsolicited calls for recruitment.
* If we're working regarding a role or candidate, we'll explain how best to contact us about that role/candidate.

### How to Start Working With Us

* Please don't email us suggesting a call to discuss our hiring.
* If you want to know about available jobs, please keep an eye on our jobs page.
* Each position will have its own specific email address. Please send CVs to that email address for that position only.
* Please read the description of the role carefully and only send appropriate candidates.

### CVs / Candidates

* Please do not send us anonymous CVs - they will unfortunately not be considered. If you send us a candidate, we want to know who they are, where they've worked and whether we've seen them before.
* When sending us a CV, please include the candidate's salary expectations and availability.
* We typically only consider candidates already in the UK. If they are not in the UK, please tell us.

The terms we work to are below:

Important: these Terms supersede any similar terms in individual agency's contracts.

* We will pay within 30 days of invoicing
* The invoice date can be no earlier than the candidate's start date
* If a candidate is employed by us within 6 months of an introduction by you, we will pay your fee.
* If a candidate you introduce is already known to us (organically or from a different agency) we will tell you this promptly. No fee will be payable in this circumstance.
* If the candidate leaves within 12 working weeks of their start date (for any reason, including dismissal), you will try to find a replacement free of charge.
* If you are unable to find a replacement acceptable to us you will refund 8.3% of your fee for each week of the first 12 the candidate didn't work.
